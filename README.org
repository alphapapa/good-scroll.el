** Setup
Install and load the package.
Then, enable ~good-scroll-mode~.
For example, you can add the following snippet to your config.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(good-scroll-mode 1)
#+end_src
** FAQ
*** How does this work?
Instead of scroll events directly scrolling the screen,
they update a destination variable.
A timer that runs every ~good-scroll-render-rate~ seconds
calculates the expected position and actually scrolls the window to it.
To make the window scrolled partially through a line,
~good-scroll~ updates the window's /vscroll/ (vertical scroll) position.
